# MedioCode
a small website

This is just a small website I built for fun. Anyone can use it as a template for their own website. Although, there are much better templates elsewhere!

# repeat-27 class and repeat27 function.
You may notice that the markup is significantly smaller than the size of the page. This is because my javascript file repeats anything with the class repeat-27.
This is primarily to show the sticky nav.
